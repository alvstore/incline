# Security & Lint Audit — phased fixes (2026-10-08)
Source doc: /mnt/documents/Incline_Security_Lint_Audit.md

- [x] Phase 1a — lock 51 internal-only privileged functions to background jobs (migration 0010)
- [x] Phase 1b — in-function permission checks for the 26 app-called functions (migrations 0011–0013; verified live as member + owner: 47 checks)
- [x] Phase 2 — read-function leaks closed (migration 0014): 15 locked to background, 6 helpers self-or-staff, audit reports owner/admin; 5 visitor-open functions rechecked (body-scan token fn locked; share links never issued)
- [x] Phase 3 — remaining signed-in-callable privileged functions reviewed (migrations 0015–0016: 27 locked to background, guards on purchase/lifecycle/punch/consent/scan-quota/presence/measurement helpers); default-deny for new functions is migration 0018
- [x] Phase 4 — pg_trgm + vector moved to `extensions` (0017; pg_net not relocatable — its objects already live in `net`); new functions closed by default (0018); CI step `scripts/check-definer-guards.ts` fails unprotected SECURITY DEFINER functions
- [ ] Phase 3 follow-ups — fix `match_common_plans` cross-member read (guard uses caller instead of target); verify member self-service PT add-on purchase still works end-to-end; confirm `resolve_mips_person_alias` backend callers are service-role
- [ ] Phase 5 — clear 38 lint warnings
- [ ] Phase 6 — verify as member + front-desk after each phase; update audit doc status
